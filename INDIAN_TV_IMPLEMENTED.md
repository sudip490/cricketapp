# ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Indian IPTV App (Exact Source)

## What I Did

You provided the `kananinirav/Indian-IPTV-App` repo. I cloned it, analyzed the code, and extracted the **exact channel source** used by that app.

### 1. Source Extracted from Repo
- **File**: `lib/provider/channels_provider.dart`
- **Source Found**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FunctionError/PiratesTv/main/combined_playlist.m3u`

### 2. Implemented in `/indian-tv`
- I updated the **Indian TV API** to fetch data from this specific URL.
- This means your web app now has the **exact same channels** as the Android app you linked!

### 3. Features
- 📺 **Same Channel List** as the Indian IPTV Android App
- 🔍 **Search & Categories**
- ▶️ **Web Player** (No APK needed)

Your `/indian-tv` page is now powered by the source code you provided! 🚀
